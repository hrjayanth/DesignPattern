# Observer Pattern

* The *Observer Pattern* is a Behavioral design pattern and is part of the GoF's formal list of design patterns.
* This Pattern allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.
* It specifies communication between objects: **Observable** and **Observers**. 
* An observable is an object which notifies observers about the changes in its state.
