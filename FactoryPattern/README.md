# Factory Design Pattern

* The *Factory Pattern* is a Creational design pattern and is part of the GoFâ€˜s formal list of design patterns.
* This pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
* This pattern delegates the responsibility of initializing a class from the client to a particular factory class by creating a type of virtual constructor.
