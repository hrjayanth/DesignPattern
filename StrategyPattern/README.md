# Strategy Design Pattern

* The *Strategy Pattern* is a Behavioral design pattern and is part of the GoFâ€˜s formal list of design patterns.
* The strategy pattern allows us to change the behavior of an algorithm at runtime.
* Typically, we would start with an interface which is used to apply an algorithm, and then implement it multiple times for each possible algorithm.
