# Gang of Four Design Patterns

1. Creational Design Patterns
    * **Abstract Factory:** Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type.
    * **Builder:** Uses to create complex objects.
    * **Factory Method:** Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
    * **Prototype:** Creates a new object from an existing object.
    * **Singleton:** Ensures only one instance of an object is created.

2. Structural Design Patterns
    * **Adapter:** Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.
    * **Bridge:** Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.
    * **Composite:** Takes a group of objects into a single object.
    * **Decorator:** Allows for an object's behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.
    * **Facade:** Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.
    * **Flyweight:** Reduces the cost of complex object models.
    * **Proxy:** Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.

3. Behavior Design Patterns
    * **Chain of Responsibility:** Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
    * **Command:** Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
    * **Interpreter:** Implements a specialized language.
    * **Iterator:** Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
    * **Mediator:** Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
    * **Memento:** Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
    * **Observer:** Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
    * **State:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
    * **Strategy:** Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.
    * **Template Method:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.
    * **Visitor:** Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
