# Gang of Four Design Patterns

1. Creational Design Patterns
    * **[Abstract Factory](./AbstractFactoryPattern/README.md):** Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type.
    * **[Builder](./BuilderPattern/README.md):** Uses to create complex objects.
    * **[Factory Method](./FactoryPattern/README.md):** Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
    * **Prototype:** Creates a new object from an existing object.
    * **[Singleton](./SingletonPattern/README.md):** Ensures only one instance of an object is created.

2. Structural Design Patterns
    * **[Adapter](./AdapterPattern/README.md):** Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.
    * **[Bridge](./BridgePattern/README.md):** Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.
    * **[Composite](./CompositePattern/README.md):** Takes a group of objects into a single object.
    * **[Decorator](./DecoratorPattern/README.md):** Allows for an object's behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.
    * **[Facade](./FacadePattern/README.md):** Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.
    * **Flyweight:** Reduces the cost of complex object models.
    * **[Proxy](./ProxyPattern/README.md):** Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.

3. Behavioral Design Patterns
    * **Chain of Responsibility:** Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
    * **[Command](./CommandPattern/README.md):** Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
    * **Interpreter:** Implements a specialized language.
    * **[Iterator](./IteratorPattern/README.md):** Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
    * **Mediator:** Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
    * **Memento:** Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
    * **[Observer](./ObserverPattern/README.md):** Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
    * **[State](./StatePattern/README.md):** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
    * **[Strategy](./StrategyPattern/README.md):** Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.
    * **[Template Method](./TemplateMethodPattern/README.md):** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.
    * **[Visitor](./VisitorPattern/README.md):** Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
