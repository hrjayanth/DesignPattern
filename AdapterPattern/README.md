# Adapter Pattern

* An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly.
* An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the client's interface.

## When to Use Adapter Pattern

* When an outside component provides captivating functionality that we'd like to reuse, but it's incompatible with our current application. A suitable Adapter can be developed to make them compatible with each other
* When our application is not compatible with the interface that our client is expecting
* When we want to reuse legacy code in our application without making any modification in the original code
