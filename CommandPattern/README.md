# Command Pattern

* The *Command Pattern* is a Behavioral design pattern and is part of the GoFâ€˜s formal list of design patterns.
* The pattern intends to encapsulate in an object all the data required for performing a given action (command), including what method to call, the method's arguments, and the object to which the method belongs.
* This model allows us to decouple objects that produce the commands from their consumers, so that's why the pattern is commonly known as the *Producer-Consumer pattern*.
