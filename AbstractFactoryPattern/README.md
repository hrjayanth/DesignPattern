# Abstract Factory Pattern

* The *Abstract Factory Pattern* is a Creational design pattern and is part of the GoFâ€˜s formal list of design patterns.
* Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes

## When to Use Abstract Factory Pattern:
* The client is independent of how we create and compose the objects in the system
* The system consists of multiple families of objects, and these families are designed to be used together
* We need a run-time value to construct a particular dependency
