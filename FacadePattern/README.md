# Facade Pattern

* * The *Facade Pattern* is a Structural design pattern and is part of the GoF's formal list of design patterns.
* A facade encapsulates a complex subsystem behind a simple interface. It hides much of the complexity and makes the subsystem easy to use.
* It decouples a client implementation from the complex subsystem.
* Below is a class diagram representing the facade Pattern:
