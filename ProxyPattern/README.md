# Proxy Pattern

* The *Proxy Pattern* is a Structural design pattern and is part of the GoFâ€˜s formal list of design patterns.
* The Proxy pattern allows us to create an intermediary that acts as an interface to another resource, while also hiding the underlying complexity of the component.

## When to Use Proxy?

* When we want a simplified version of a complex or heavy object.
* When the original object is present in different address space, and we want to represent it locally.
* When we want to add a layer of security to the original underlying object to provide controlled access based on access rights of the client. This is called Protection Proxy
